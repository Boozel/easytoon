# easytoon
A holder for an animation software "EasyToon".


#COMPILATION:
EasyToon seems to compile just fine with Visual Studio 2008's stock compiler. It has a linker issue (missing signal?),
but it doesn't seem to break builds/crash the application...

#PLANS
I think I'm going to turn this project into a modern QT application. That would make it available for OSX and Linux
as well as Windows. Plus, it could be built with a modern compiler...
